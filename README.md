Assignment Title: Advanced Data Analysis Dashboard
Description: You are tasked with creating an advanced data analysis dashboard for a
fictional company that collects and analyzes various types of data. The dashboard should
allow users to upload CSV files containing data, visualize the data in various formats (e.g.,
charts, graphs), perform advanced data manipulations and calculations, and export the
results.
Requirements:
1. User Interface (UI): Develop a responsive web application interface using HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript frameworks like React or Angular. Include features for user
authentication and authorization to ensure data privacy and security.
2. Data Upload and Processing: Implement a feature that allows users to upload CSV
files containing data. Design a mechanism to parse and validate the uploaded CSV
files. Implement asynchronous file processing to handle large datasets without
blocking the UI.
3. Data Visualization: Utilize libraries like D3.js or Chart.js to create dynamic
visualizations (e.g., line charts, bar graphs, pie charts) based on the uploaded data.
Allow users to customize the visualizations by selecting different data attributes and
aggregation functions.
4. Advanced Data Manipulation: Implement advanced data manipulation features
such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating data based on user-defined
criteria. Support complex data transformations and calculations (e.g., calculating
moving averages, trend analysis).
5. Export and Reporting: Provide functionality for users to export the analyzed data
and visualizations in various formats (e.g., CSV, PDF). Implement reporting features
allowing users to save and load analysis sessions for future reference.
6. Performance Optimization: Optimize the application's performance, especially
concerning data processing and rendering, to ensure smooth user experience even
with large datasets. Implement lazy loading and pagination techniques for handling
large datasets efficiently.
7. Error Handling and Validation: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to
gracefully handle unexpected errors and edge cases. Validate user inputs and
provide meaningful error messages for incorrect or incomplete data.
8. Documentation and Testing: Document the codebase thoroughly, including inline
comments, README files, and API documentation if applicable. Write unit tests using
frameworks like Jest or Mocha to ensure code reliability and maintainability.
9. Bonus Points (Optional):
Implement real-time data updates using WebSockets or other appropriate technologies.
Integrate with external APIs to fetch additional data for analysis.
Implement data caching and offline support for improved performance and reliability.
This assignment is challenging because it requires a deep understanding of JavaScript, web
development principles, data manipulation techniques, and software engineering best
practices. Additionally, students would need to demonstrate creativity in designing an
intuitive user interface and efficiency in handling complex data analysis tasks.
